# TheBigPicture
Our floor has a very lively group chat and we wanted to extract as much personal information as possible (and find embarrassing moments/ statistics).

This was a project completed during CalHacks 2.0 at UC Berkeley in 2015.

It parses groups chat and then organizes it into clusters where each clusters is separated by 20 minutes of silence/ inactivity. Then it outputs statistics about the clusters such as most talkative, most lonely (last message of a cluster) as well as statistics about the chat as a whole.

Used JavaScript to parse input messages and run analysis on it. The use html/css and d3 to display the data in graphical form.
